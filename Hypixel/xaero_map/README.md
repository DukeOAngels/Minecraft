# 🧭 Hypixel SkyBlock NPC Waypoints

Adds **waypoints for nearly all Hypixel NPCs** — making it easier to find important characters across different islands.  
Perfect for **new or returning players** who want to learn island layouts and navigate faster.

🧱 **Currently includes:** Hub, Gold Mine, Deep Caverns, and more.  
🚧 **Work in progress:** Jungle Island and beyond, Spider’s Den and beyond, Dungeon Hub portals, Dwarven Mines markers, and possibly some other missed NPCs.
